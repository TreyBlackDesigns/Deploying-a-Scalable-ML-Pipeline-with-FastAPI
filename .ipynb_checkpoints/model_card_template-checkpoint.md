Model Details
This model is a Random Forest Classifier designed to predict income level based on a variety of features. It was developed for the Census Bureau.

Intended Use
The model is intened for use in analytics. It should be applied to socioeconomic fields.

Training Data
The training data consist of a Census dataset that includes age, work class, education, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, and native country.

Evaluation Data
The evaluation was conducted using a random split from the orginal data.2 0% of the original dataset was allocated as the test dataset. This test data is just as diverse as the real world data.

Metrics
Overall Performance:

Precision: 0.7317 Recall: 0.6377 F1 Score: 0.6815

Performance on Data Slices: Workclass: Private Precision: 0.7259 Recall: 0.6371 F1 Score: 0.6786

Education: Bachelors Precision: 0.7251 Recall: 0.7773 F1 Score: 0.7503

Ethical Considerations
The diversity in the data set is reflective of the real world. Users of the model should be aware of the possiblity of residual biases.

Caveats and Recommendations
While it does create good results. The model should be not be used as a primary decision making tool. I would recommend continuing to train this model to relfect changing socioecconmic trends.
